I got a Master of Computing degree from Australian National University, Canberra, Australia in 2009, and a PhD degree from Griffith University, Queensland, Australia in 2020.  I am currently working at the Australian National University (ANU) and CSIRO as a postdoctoral research fellow. Before that, I was working as a researcher at ARC Research Hub for Driving Farming Productivity and Disease Prevention, Griffith University, Australia. Prior to that, I worked as a developer/programmer at Griffith University, Australia, and before that, I worked as Assistant Professor at COMSATS University, Lahore, Pakistan.
